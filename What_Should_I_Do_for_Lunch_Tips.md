### What Should I Do for Lunch?

When deciding what to eat for lunch, consider the following tips:

- **Take a break**: It's important to step away from your desk and clear your mind. If you can, try going for a short walk before deciding on lunch. A bit of fresh air can help you think more clearly.
  
- **Keep it simple**: If you're struggling to decide what to eat, stick with something you know and like. It's better to eat something familiar than to stress about trying something new.
  
- **Listen to your body**: Pay attention to how you're feeling. Are you craving something light or something more filling? Your body often knows what it needs.
